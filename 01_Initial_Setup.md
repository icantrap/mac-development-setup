# Initial Setup

Here's the stuff you do when you first get your machine. I'm assuming the machine has El Capitan on it, but much of the following is applicable in previous versions. Your mileage may vary.

I also assume that knowledge of the various methods of installing software are known.

Some of the following are a matter of preference. Skip those bits, if you like.

## System Update

Go ahead and do this. It could take quite a while.

1. ** Apple Icon -> About This Mac**
1. Click the **Software Update** button at the bottom of the dialog.

## Screen Resolution

While update is happening, you can adjust your resolution.

1. Open **System Preferences -> Displays**
1. On your **Built-in Retina Display** tab, select the **Scaled** radio button.
1. Pick **More Space**! Your eyes can handle it!

## Clean Up Your Dock

This can also be down while things are being downloaded. If you're only use the machine for development, you likely don't need things like Garage Band and Photos on your Dock.

1. Right-click on the item you'd like to remove from your Dock and click **Options -> Remove From Dock**.

On the other hand, there are probably programs you want to keep on your Dock. If a program is currently running,

1. Right-click on the running program and click **Options -> Keep in Dock**.

Since, we're here, let's put the Dock on the right-side of the display. It'll give you more vertical space to work with.

1. Open **System Preference -> Dock**.
1. Select the **Right** radio button.

## Chrome Browser

My browser of choice is Chrome. You're going to have to run Safari at least once to download the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

Start up the browser, and it should ask you if you want it to be the default. Yes, you do.

Install your favorite extensions, such as:

1. [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org)
2. [mightytext](https://mightytext.net/install)

## Dropbox

File sharing software. 1Password password manager provides syncing via Dropbox, so I install Dropbox first.

1. (Download)[https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?src=index] and install.
2. Follow the instructions to setup your Dropbox folder.

## 1Password

Dealing with lots of different accounts requires dealing with lots of passwords. This password manager can help.

1. [Download](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac) and install.
1. Once you run the software, it'll detect if you have previously synced 1Password using Dropbox.
1. **1Password -> Install Browser Extensions** to install browser integration.

## iTerm 2

You're a developer; you should be using the command line. iTerm 2 is a Terminal replacement. Download and install the latest version [here](http://www.iterm2.com).

1. Run iTerm 2.
1. **Cmd-,** for settings.
1. Uncheck **Confirm closing multiple sessions** and **Confirm "Quit iTerm2 (Cmd+Q)" command**.

## Atom Editor

An all-purpose text editor can come in handy. [Download](https://atom.io) and install.

## Slack

If you're part of a team, there's a good chance, you're using [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads).
