# nodejs

# nvm

[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) allows you to select between multiple installed versions of nodejs for your various projects, similar to rvm or rbenv.

```shell
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
```

After the installation is done, either close and reopen your console, or reload your shell resource file.

# nodejs

Install a version of node like so:

```shell
$ nvm install 4.4.4
```

Install [nodemon](http://nodemon.io) or [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), for kicks ...

```shell
$ npm install -g nodemon gulp
```
